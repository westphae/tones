# Tones

This project is just a personal exploration of tonal relationships, for my own education.
It's not really intended for others to use, but if you find anything useful, enjoy and let me know!

The current page at https://westphae.github.io/tones lets you explore intervals in Just Intonation (JI) and Equal Temperament (ET).
The sound used is a slide whistle; I may add a piano soon.
I think I find the direction of resolution easier to discern with JI than with ET, but I'm not sure.
The direction of resolution is still a bit of a challenge for me to discern anyway!

The "Play" button plays the chosen interval.
The "Compare" button plays the chosen intervallic note first in ET and then in JI.
The JI tuning is to A2, 220 Hz.
